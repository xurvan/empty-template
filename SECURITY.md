# Security Policy

## Introduction

This security policy outlines how security is handled for this project, how to
report vulnerabilities, and what to expect in response. Our team is committed to
ensuring the security of our project and appreciates the efforts of security
researchers and our user community in identifying potential vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

We only support the latest released version of our project (latest GitHub
release). Before reporting a vulnerability, please check that you are using the
latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you've found a
security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by
   our team.
2. We use GitHub Security Advisories for vulnerability reporting. Please report
   security vulnerabilities
   through [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).
3. If you're unable to use GitHub Security Advisories, you may email your
   findings to [security@backtick.group](mailto:security@backtick.group) as an
   alternative.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential solutions you've identified
- Your name/handle if you wish to be credited for the discovery

### What to Expect

After you've submitted a vulnerability report, you can expect the following:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2. **Verification**: Our team will work to verify the vulnerability and its impact.
3. **Updates**: We will provide regular updates as our investigation progresses.
4. **Resolution**: Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and
   coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline.

## Disclosure Policy

- The vulnerability will remain private until a fix is ready.
- Once a fix is ready, we will release it as soon as possible.
- After the fix is released, we will publicly acknowledge the vulnerability and
  the reporter (if desired).
- We aim to address and release fixes for vulnerabilities within 90 days of the
  report.

## Security Update Process

Security updates will be released in the following ways:

1. For critical vulnerabilities, we will release a patch as soon as possible.
2. For less severe issues, fixes may be included in regular releases.
3. Release notes will clearly indicate when security fixes are included.
4. Users will be notified through our regular communication channels.

## Best Practices for Users

To help ensure the security of your implementation:

1. Always use the latest version of the project.
2. Apply security patches promptly.
3. Follow security best practices relevant to the programming language and
   environment.
4. Regularly audit your dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
5. Implement proper access controls and authentication mechanisms.
6. Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS, SSH, etc.).
